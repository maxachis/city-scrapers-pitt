# City Scrapers Pittsburgh

[![Build status](https://github.com/pgh-public-meetings/city-scrapers-pitt/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pgh-public-meetings/city-scrapers-pitt/actions)

This is a City Scrapers project being run in Pittsburgh. We are templated off of the [City Scrapers](https://cityscrapers.org) project.

## What is City Scrapers?

City Scrapers is a national volunteer project based around improving government meeting transparency and accessibility by creating code scripts, known as "spiders", that "scrape" meeting data from multiple government websites in a region and combine them into a single, searchable [calendar](https://pgh-public-meetings.github.io/events/). 

## How do I start coding?

If you're ready to jump right into making a spider, check out our [Issues](), where we have a wide number of spiders and other requested tasks to work on.

If you're new to coding or webscraping, get started by going through our [documentation](https://pgh-public-meetings.github.io/city-scrapers-pitt)!
